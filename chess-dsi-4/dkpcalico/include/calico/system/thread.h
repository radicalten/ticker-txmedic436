/*! @addtogroup thread

	Calico provides a simple preemptive multithreading system. Each thread is
	assigned a priority level and has its own execution state, allowing software
	to be better structured by having different processing tasks each in its own
	thread. Threads may wait on events such as interrupts. Calico ensures at all
	times that the currently running thread is always the highest priority thread
	that can run. If any event occurs that causes a higher priority thread to
	become runnable, Calico will preempt the current thread. Unlike in common PC
	operating systems, Calico presently does not implement timeslicing to share
	the CPU between threads of the same priority; meaning it is necessary to
	explicitly yield control of the CPU if any such threads exist.

	While Calico provides its own threading API, it is also possible to use standard
	threading APIs such as POSIX threads or C++ threads. These APIs are in fact
	preferred when working with cross platform projects.
